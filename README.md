# Hi there, welcome to my Data Engineering Portfolio!

I'm glad you stopped by. This space is a work in progress, and honestly, that's part of the fun. I started this portfolio to share my journey as I learn, build, and sometimes stumble while exploring various technologies and techniques. Whether you are here to exploring my capabilities, or just someone curious about data, I hope you find something here that feels real and useful.

## What you'll find here

Right now, I'm working on projects that show how I approach data problems using tools like:

- **ETL pipelines** (the backbone of moving and shaping data)
- **Delta Lake** (for keeping data reliable and easy to work with)
- **Apache Spark** (because big data needs big solutions)
- **Apache Airflow** (to keep all those moving parts in sync)
- **Power BI** (to bring insights into chaos)

I'm always tinkering, so you'll probably see new tools and ideas pop up as I go. I try to keep things practical and honest—these are the kinds of projects I'd want to work on in the real world.

## Why I'm building this

I love making data systems that actually help people and businesses. I'm not perfect, and I don't know everything, but I love figuring things out and sharing what I learn. This portfolio is my way of showing how I solve problems, write code that makes sense, and keep learning as the field changes.

## Who's this for?

If you're looking for someone who's hands-on, curious, and open to feedback, you're in the right place. I want this portfolio to be a conversation starter, not just a list of skills. Feel free to reach out, ask questions, or suggest something I should try next.

## Portfolio Projects

### Metro
The Metro project is my hands-on exploration of public transit data. Here, I’ve built ETL pipelines to ingest, clean, and transform raw train and station data, then modeled it for analytics and reporting. I use tools like Apache Spark and Delta Lake to process large datasets, and Power BI to visualise patronage trends and operational insights. This project is a practical showcase of how I approach real-world data engineering challenges—from wrangling CSVs to orchestrating workflows and surfacing insights for decision-makers.

**Portfolio Items:**
- Metro: Public transit data engineering and analytics (ETL, Spark, Delta Lake, Power BI)
- Bronze/Silver/Gold Data Profiling: Data quality and profiling notebooks
- Data Pipeline Scripts: Modular Python scripts for data curation and transformation
- Config Management: Environment and configuration templates for reproducible workflows

Thanks again for visiting. I'll keep updating this as I grow, so check back for new projects, stories, and maybe a few lessons learned the hard way.
