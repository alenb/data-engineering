## Schema Explanation

At the centre of the star schema is the `fact_train` table, which records each train's stop event, including passenger counts, scheduled times, and keys to all relevant dimensions. Surrounding it are dimension tables:

- **dim_date**: Contains calendar information for each business date, including day of week, type, and date key.
- **dim_train**: Describes each train, including its number, mode, line, direction, and endpoints.
- **dim_station**: Details about each station, such as name, latitude, longitude, and chainage.
- **dim_line**: Information about train lines and their groupings.
- **dim_mode**: The mode of transport (e.g., train, tram).
- **dim_direction**: Direction of travel, with descriptions for clarity.
- **dim_time_bucket**: Time intervals for arrivals and departures, supporting time-based analysis.

The fact table links to each dimension via surrogate keys, enabling fast joins and flexible queries. This structure supports slicing and dicing the data by any combination of date, train, station, line, mode, direction, or time bucketâ€”ideal for business intelligence and operational reporting.

## Table Column Breakdown
